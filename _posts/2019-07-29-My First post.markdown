This is my first post.

  &ensp;&ensp;It's been a long since I wanted to make a blog, but I haven't tried before. A reason for this is because I've had a hard time, trying to figure out what a blog should contain and how it should be structured to be interesting. Recently Ι decided to give it another chance, so here we are! 

&ensp;&ensp;I want to use this blog mainly to archive various programming projects I'm working on and more specifically in a way that is easy to reproduce and maintain.
  The next post will be about the steps I took and the tools I used to create this blog. 



Thanks for visiting, I would love to see a comment. ✌





P.S: I used, [Grammarly][Grammarly-editor] to help me with the spelling and grammar of this, but still, I feel like there are mistakes here and there. Nevertheless, some grammar mistakes shouldn't be a reason to stop me from my thrive to speak (more like, to write!), besides practice makes perfect as they say.
